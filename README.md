## ODO QWERTZ v1.0.1 – Unexpected Keyboard Layout

A fully custom, corner-mapped, symbol-rich **QWERTZ** keyboard layout for everyday coding, writing, and symbolic precision on touch devices.

> Designed to **maximise utility**, **minimise abstraction**, and saturate every key—north, east, west, and south—with meaning.

### Features

* **Full QWERTZ layout**, with logical rearrangement of coding essentials
* Every key has up to four **corner-assigned symbols** (`nw`, `ne`, `sw`, `se`)
* Focus on:

  * Quotes: straight, curly, low/high, guillemets, reversed, fullwidth
  * Brackets, braces, slashes, pipes
  * Currency symbols (₦, £)
  * Punctuation & logic essentials
* Optimised for **Termux**, Vim, mobile code editing, and Markdown authorship
* Stored in clean, portable `.xml` format (usable in custom Android keyboards or parsable for build tools)

### Philosophy

Every symbol should serve a purpose. Every corner should carry weight.

> No wasted space. No shallow defaults. Just raw utility.
